ðŸŒ¿ Farmer Market - A MERN Stack E-commerce Platform for Local Farmers

Farmer Market is a full-stack e-commerce web application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack.
It connects local farmers directly with customers, enabling them to showcase and sell fresh, organic produce. 
The platform features a dynamic farmer dashboard for product management (CRUD), secure JWT-based authentication, live search,
a shopping cart with real-time stock validation, Razorpay payment integration, and a beautiful animated UI with green-themed aesthetics.
Customers can view paid orders, contact support, and explore legal pages like Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions â€” all backed by a clean MVC-R architecture.
